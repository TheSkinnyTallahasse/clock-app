We brainstormed ideas and came up with a clock app.  We're planning to make a clock app that has a clock, timer, stopwatch, and alarm.  
For the alarm we are going to have it so that we can set our music.  
For the stopwatch we will have a lap function so that people can split up the different times.  
For the timer we are going to make it so people can set the time it starts and maybe even be able to do it with your voice.
We are thinking of trying to make it into an iphone port.  But that's only if we finish everything and still have some time left over.  
Unfortunately we haven't started coding yet. Right now we haven't even created the blueJ file on it.
We'll attempt to start coding this weakend.  Starting this project will probably be relatively slow but as we gain momentum our rate of production will probably go higher.

We started our project.  We had no idea how to start the code so we went onto stackoverflow for some help.  It gave us a good kickstart and helped us get the imports we needed.
We started the clock part of the project. So far we have successfully created a datestamp.  Now you can check army time and date.  Unfortunately it looks really bland right now and its only a date stamp which means you have to continually refresh it.
I learned today that we can't always just use .* because if you have multiple import types they will overlap eachother.  For example there is Javax.swing.Timer and there is a Java.util.Timer so it ends up with an error when you use .* with both of them.
That's the main thing we have learned today but now it makes sense why Schreiber was wary whenever someone asked if we can just put .* whenever he told us to put in an import.
