Talha and I have decided to work together on the 20% project. 
We have decided to create an application that allows the user to: check the time, create an alarm ( the alarm tone can be set to a specified song), and a stopwatch that can start/stop and record splits.
Ideally, we would like to make the clock application compatiable on phones. The reason we chose to create a clock application is because everyone is affected by time constraints. Our application can be
a useful tool for people within their everyday lives. Since we are now finished with the outline, we will now start coding. This weekend we will decide which of the three parts (clock, alarm, stopwatch)
we will work on first. I am excited to implement the coding skills we have learned in this class to create a practical application.
If progress is slow, we may try to receive outside help from computer science experts (within the community like Micron workers, or from online forums).
